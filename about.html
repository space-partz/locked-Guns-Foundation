                    <p>The Locked Guns Foundation is a dedicated family committed to fostering a community of opportunity and security against gun violence. Rooted in our belief in responsible gun access, we strive to raise awareness and provide tangible solutions that prioritize the safety of children and families impacted by gun violence.

                    Our mission is driven by a deep sense of responsibility to our community and a passion for protecting the lives of the most vulnerable. We have developed a tamper-actuated fluid release firearm lock—a groundbreaking invention designed to prevent unauthorized access to firearms. This innovative solution is at the heart of our foundation's efforts to reduce the tragic consequences of gun violence, particularly the loss of young lives.</p>
