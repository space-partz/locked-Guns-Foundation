🔒 **Locked Guns Project** 🔒  
Welcome to the *Locked Guns* GitHub repository—a project dedicated to promoting firearm safety through responsible gun access and awareness. Our mission is simple yet powerful: to create safer communities by reducing gun violence, particularly in areas where it disproportionately affects children and families. 

At the heart of this project is a unique firearm lock technology—a tamper-actuated fluid release system that ensures firearms can only be accessed responsibly. We’re passionate about making a real impact, and this public repository is a place where innovation, safety, and collaboration come together.

This project began with a simple yet critical goal: to provide a meaningful solution to prevent unauthorized access to firearms and reduce gun-related accidents. The *Locked Guns Foundation* was built by a fourth-generation American Muslim family committed to this mission, and today, we’re growing a community of advocates, innovators, and problem solvers.
